Routing
- Wireless router generating network


Static
- Manually create and manage routing table entries
- Use command line utilities to display, modify, and create routes
- Routes remain unchanged until manuallu updated

- Suitable for Small networks & environment where network is static

- Scalability issue

Dynamic
- Used when static route is impractical due to frequent change on routing table

Ruting information protocol (RIP)
- Send routing table to everything every 30 seconds
- Use Hop count as metric for distance
- Each router = 1 hop

Open shortest path first (OSPF)
- Uses link state advertisement (LSAs)
- Efficient and faster convergence than RIP
- Require to use medium level of power and storage
