# WEEK 2
## IP addressing structures
- Can be automatic or manually
- If manual,
- Subnet mask, default getway, preferred DNS server
IPV4
- Is 32 bit or 4 8 bit chunks


1 IP address has 2 sections
  Nework and Node
There are 3 diffrent classes
Class A = 0111 (First digit always 0)
- Network(8) and Node(24)
First 8-bit = 00000000 = 011111111
0-127
  
Class B = 1011 (2nd digit always 0)
- Network (16) and Node (16)
128-191
First 8-bit = 10000000 = 10111111

Class C = 1101 (3rd digit always 0)
- Nework (24) and Node (8)
First 8-bit = 11000000 = 11011111
192-255
  
We can practice converting decimal to 8-bit binary using a decimal to binary conversion activity

0 = RESERVED
1- 126= RANGE
127 = LOOPBACK

NETWORK ADDRESS/BROADCAST 
We use the AND rule for this
