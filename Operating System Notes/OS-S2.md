## Program
Programs are passive entites stores on the disk (Executabel
- States
- New
- Running
- Waiting
- Ready
- Terminated

## Program control block
Each process has PCB(Program control lock)
- Process state
- Program counter
- CPU registers
- CPU scheduling information
- Memory management
- Acccoutning Information
- SOMETING

## Process Scheduling
- Process schedulers select among avalible processes for next execution on the CPU core
- The goal is to maximaize CPU use
- Maintains Scheduling queues of processes like *Ready Queue* and *Wait Queues*
- Processes migrate among various queues
