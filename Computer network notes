The layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model are the different stages of network communication between hardware and software. The layers are: 
1) Physical layer: Transmits raw data between a device and a physical medium. This layer is responsible for the physical representation of the system, including the electrical and optical components. 
2) Data link layer: One of the layers of the OSI model 
3) Network layer: One of the layers of the OSI model 
4) Transport layer: Manages the delivery of data packets between systems and hosts. This layer also checks for errors and regulates the size and sequencing of data. 
5) Session layer: Manages the establishment, maintenance, and termination of connections between applications. This layer also handles authentication and reconnection after an interruption. 
6) Presentation layer: Translates data between the application layer and the network format. This layer also handles encryption, compression, and data formatting. 
7) Application layer: One of the layers of the OSI model 

The OSI model was designed to allow different systems to communicate with each other using standardized protocols.
