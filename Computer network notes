OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection, a model that describes how computer systems communicate over a network. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the OSI model. 

The layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model are the different stages of network communication between hardware and software. The layers are: 
1) Physical layer: Transmits raw data between a device and a physical medium. This layer is responsible for the physical representation of the system, including the electrical and optical components. 
2) Data link layer: One of the layers of the OSI model 
3) Network layer: One of the layers of the OSI model 
4) Transport layer: Manages the delivery of data packets between systems and hosts. This layer also checks for errors and regulates the size and sequencing of data. 
5) Session layer: Manages the establishment, maintenance, and termination of connections between applications. This layer also handles authentication and reconnection after an interruption. 
6) Presentation layer: Translates data between the application layer and the network format. This layer also handles encryption, compression, and data formatting. 
7) Application layer: One of the layers of the OSI model 

The OSI model was designed to allow different systems to communicate with each other using standardized protocols. 



"TCP/IP layers" refer to the different levels within the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model, a framework that defines how data is transmitted across networks, with each layer performing a specific function like managing addressing, ensuring reliable delivery, or interacting with applications at the user level; the four primary layers in the TCP/IP model are: Application Layer, Transport Layer, Internet Layer, and Network Interface Layer

Explanation of each layer:
1) Application Layer:
This top layer directly interacts with user applications like web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs, handling data formatting and user-specific protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. 
2) Transport Layer:
Responsible for establishing a reliable connection between two devices, managing data segmentation, flow control, and error detection to ensure data is delivered correctly. Protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) operate at this layer. 
3) Internet Layer:
This layer manages the logical addressing and routing of data packets across networks using IP (Internet Protocol) addresses, determining the best path to send data to the destination. 
4) Network Interface Layer:
This lowest layer handles the physical transmission of data on the network, interacting directly with hardware like network cards and managing data frames on the local network.
