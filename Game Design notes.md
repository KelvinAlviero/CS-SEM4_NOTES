# WEEK 2

### 8 types of fun
- Sensation
  - Fame as a sense pleasure, these evoke emotion to the player, things like sound, visual, controller rumble and physical effort
- Fantasy
  - Gaames as make-believe, they're meant to take the players into a another world, sorta like escapism
- Narrative
  - Unlike Narative, you want to BE in the story and world
  - Drama of the game
  - Similar to fantasy but you just listen to the story
- Challenge
- Fellowship
  - Games with high amount of social interaction
- Discovery
  - Games with exploration/uncharted territory
- Expression
  - Games with self discovery, allowing players to express themselves through gameplay
- Submission
  - Pasttime/time kiler games, these have farming or grinding as a core element
