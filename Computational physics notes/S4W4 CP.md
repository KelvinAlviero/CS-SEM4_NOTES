- Derivative
  - Used for the slope (Slooooop)

### Trapezoidal rule
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac1dd925-73d9-4bf8-ad14-32574ea2589c)
-  A better approach, involing less work where the area is divided into trapezoids instead of rectangles
- Trapezoids under the area are usually *better* aproximation rather than the straight up area of the curve
- More slices mean more accuracy
- *BUT* more slices mean more work, including when ran by a *code/program*, use when necesarry.

### Simpson Rule
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05e89bfe-fa37-40a6-991a-f0e493b67fa8)
- Best suited when high accuracy isn't needed
- Significantly shorter and more simpler than Trapezoid rule



### Error types
- Absolute Error
``` True value -  Approximate Value ```
- Relative Error
``` ((True Value -  Approximate value)/True Value)*100% ```
- Approximation Error
``` ((True value -  Approximate Value)/Approximate Value)*100%```
- Rounding Error
``` Computer limit, not out fault usually```
