### Trapezoidal rule
-  A better approach, involing less work where the area is divided into trapezoids instead of rectangles

- Trapezoids under the area are usually *better* aproximation rather than the straight up area of the curve
- More slices mean more accuracy
- *BUT* more slices mean more work, including when ran by a *code/program*, use when necesarry.
