# WEEK 3 NOTES
## Wasn't much in slides, we finished all of them in 45 minutes. (Class is 2 hours 30 mins)
- We learnt about RAM, cache, HDD vs SSD, describing about the hierarchy tree, we described about registers too
- Most computers are in *64 bit* architecture
- when a 64 bit storage is full, it contains *2^64*
- ANY type of computer computation works with DOUBLES
- The biggest number in phython you can store is *10^308*, more than this phython will consider *infinite*
- The minimum number for phython is *10^-308*, anything below is considered *0*
- Some casses, computers may look at numbers wrong, known as a *Numerical error*, where if we see some thing as "3.3", the computer would see it as "3.2999999999...", NEVER compare floating numbers, it'll only cause errors.
- Something about *Multithreading*, I didn't hear correctly
- Multiprocessing is equivalent to sequencetial stuff
